### Project Problem Statement and Plan

Hi Jeffrey, this looks like an interesting application that meets the individual project requirements for the course.

* You have a good start on the schedule. Can you add some dates and a bit more detail to document when classes will be built out, and be sure to list unit testing, logging, hibernate, etc.? Also remember that you will document progress in a journal/blog/wiki, so status reporting could be added as a task too.

* Will the notifications functionality be a web service implementation? You may want to include a task for researching the notification portion. 

* Nice job getting those wireframes done already!
